# Roads_PathHole_Detection

This project aims at identifying and localizing poor road conditions based on real-time images. While there are multiple types of problematic road conditions, potholes are among the most damaging ones. Not only can they damage the car when its speed is too high but they can also cause a loss of control and lead to serious accidents. Therefore, this project focuses on the localization of potholes.
